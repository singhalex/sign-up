# Sign Up Form

Created a sign up form using html, css, and javascript.

The html structure is straightforward. CSS was used to style and layout the form elements. Flex was used to split the form from the side image as well as to group the input fields and labels so that they stack on top of each other.

Javascript was added to check that the passwords match and enable the submit button if they do.
